# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A game for two players who take turns marking the spaces 
in a three-by-three grid with X or O in one of the nine 
spaces in the grid. The player who succeeds in placing 
three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or 
diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a 
forced draw assuming best play from both players.

Children, friends and families can play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## My Approach

I was not sure how to even begin, so I started by watching Tutorials on how to build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Javascript.
I watched well over 20 Tutorials and read several online forms.

**Unsolved Problems**
- I had difficulty switching from the 1st player to the 2nd player
- Displaying text for a Draw Status
- Displaying the correct player for winning Status
- Adding additional features to make the game more functional
